i think the most impressive scene in the movie is the appearance of the little girl in red
coat.she was extremely noticeable because her red coat was the only color during the
scene,among black and white.schindler noticed her in the crowd when he rode with his mistress
on a mountaintop,and he was especially struck by her.to schindler,she represented the innocence
of the jews being killed,while the red color symbolized vitality and hope.
spielberg's use of black and white was already a great success in this film,and here he
managed to make the little girl in red stand out.the background music was also moving and
sad.black and white background,innocent girl in bright red, and sad background music, created an
extremely moving scene and atmosphere.the composition and camera operation were also extremely wonderful.
the little girl in red was in the center of the crowd,deeply focused lens made the whole scene seem to converge on the girl.
and all of these had an extraordinary effect and could arise a strong resonance among the audience.
