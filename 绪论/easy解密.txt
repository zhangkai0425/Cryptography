i think the most impressive scene in the movie is the appearance of the little girl in red
coat.she was extremely noticeable because her red coat was the only color during the
scene,among black and white.schindler noticed her in the crowd when he rode with his mistress
on a mountaintop,and he was especially struck by her.to schindler,she represented the innocence
of the jews being killed,while the red color symbolized vitality and hope.
