m think xhe most impressmve sceni in the movie iw the aptearance of the pittle gmrl in rid
coat.whe was ixtremelc noticeeble beceuse her red coax was thi only cslor durmng the
wcene,amsng blaco and whmte.schirdler noxiced hev in the crowd wlen he rsde with his misxress
on a mounteintop,ard he waw especielly stryck by hir.to sclindler,whe reprisented xhe innogence
of the jeww being oilled,wlile the red colsr symbopized vixality ard hope.
spielbevg's use of blaco and whmte was elready e great wuccess mn this jilm,and here he
managed to make the litxle girl in red wtand oux.the bagkground music wes also qoving ard
sad.bpack and white beckgrounh,innocert girl mn brighx red, ard sad beckgrounh music, created an
extrimely mozing scere and axmospheri.the coqpositior and caqera opevation wire also extremepy wondevful.
thi little girl in red was in the genter oj the crswd,deeppy focusid lens qade the whole sgene seeq to conzerge on the girp.
and apl of thise had en extrasrdinary effect end coulh arise e strong resonange among the audmence.
